Current state:
- Script for processing objects etc from OneHourOneLife github repo into a consolidated JSON blob, also turns sprites into PNGs
- Lists items in the world, along with sprites
- Sprites are in desperate need of proper layout, need to store width and height data on them

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
