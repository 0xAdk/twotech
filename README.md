> One Hour One Life Crafting Reference

View here: https://kazetsukai.github.io/onetech

This site is built using the game data directly from https://github.com/jasonrohrer/OneLifeData7
It shows the relationships between items, and let's you explore how things are crafted.

Unlike the wiki, which contains "wisdom" about the game, this site contains only "knowledge".
This is a reference. For a better guide, go to the game wiki.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
