Via popcorn, a corn plant used to produce 96 food (with current food bonus of 2) vs 35 for a carrot row using same water and soil.  Now a bowl of popcorn has 4 bites instead of 8, bringing the food per corn plant down to 48.  Still better than carrots as a single-ingredient food source, but it takes more steps/time to prepare, and is less portable.","date":"2018-06-01T16:57:22.000Z","objectChanges":[{"id":"1121","attributes":{"numUses":{"from":8,"to":4}}}]},{"sha":"e4d4e9ef75a04bcbfe0cb0c6a7f6430e50927815","message":"Fixed bugs in most recent content update.  Teosinte spawning, containment of popcorn bowls, missing containment of a bunch of things, duplicate straw hats.  Teosinte was way too common before.  It can now be dug up to get it out of the way.","date":"2018-06-01T15:56:43.000Z","addedTransitions":[{"actorID":"-1","targetID":"1128","newActorID":"0","newTargetID":"0","decay":"2m"},{"actorID":"722","targetID":"1107","newActorID":"722","newTargetID":"1128","tool":true},{"actorID":"722","targetID":"1123","newActorID":"722","newTargetID":"1128","tool":true}],"objectChanges":[{"id":"1107","attributes":{"mapChance":{"from":1,"to":0.25}}},{"id":"1113","attributes":{"containable":{"from":0,"to":1},"vertSlotRot":{"from":0,"to":-0.5}}},{"id":"1114","attributes":{"containable":{"from":0,"to":1}}},{"id":"1115","attributes":{"containable":{"from":0,"to":1}}},{"id":"1117","attributes":{"containable":{"from":0,"to":1},"containSize":{"from":1,"to":2},"rValue":{"from":0,"to":0.65}}},{"id":"1119","attributes":{"containable":{"from":0,"to":1}}},{"id":"1120","attributes":{"containable":{"from":1,"to":0}}},{"id":"1121","attributes":{"containable":{"from":1,"to":0}}},{"id":"1122","attributes":{"containable":{"from":1,"to":0}}},{"id":"1123","attributes":{"mapChance":{"from":1,"to":0}}}]},{"sha":"1678f6991ae0dd21d970ee566ab2e52d03d46640","message":"Made open east-west doors floor hugging so they are drawn in same layer as walls instead of behind walls.","date":"2018-06-01T15:22:17.000Z","objectChanges":[{"id":"878","attributes":{"floorHugging":{"from":0,"to":1}}},{"id":"924","attributes":{"floorHugging":{"from":0,"to":1}}}]}]}
